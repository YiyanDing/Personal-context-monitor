# Personal-context-monitor-app


In the age of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors are deployed anywhere which generated enormous data every second, and the context-aware computing has proved to understand those sensor data successfully and plays an important role in performing machine-to-machine communication. With the help of deep learning of context, this project explores as much as possible meaning contextual data and conducts a useful app based on Android platform which illustrates the basic mobile users’ behaviour and enhances interaction with third-party applications. Not only this app can help users know how their personal behaviour produce those data by visualization, but also can it interpret those data from both physical (hardware) and virtual (software) sensors into meaningful and understandable information. Data collection falls into two parts, one is collected from system settings (visits the hardware of mobile phone) such as device information, brightness of screen, volume adjustment, situation of Wi-Fi connection, battery usage and so on. Another is related to third party applications, for instance, this app can highlight which app consumed maximum traffic flow or occupied maximum storage within whole apps installed on the device, additionally, it can also reflect how often users visit and how long they stay in a particular app by clear charts. Moreover, some data close to users’ daily life and health are also included, such as daily steps, location, weather forecast (via LBS) and etc. Compared to existing context-aware app/ web service, this project helps mobile user figure out their personal smartphone usage immediately and directly by clear visualization in low cost way.

在物联网的时代中，能够产生庞大数据的传感器无处不在，而上下文感知计算技术能够很好的理解这些传感数 据，因此它在机器间通讯起着重要的作用。在深入学习了解上下文感知技术之后，本项目探索了一系列有意义 的上下文相关数据，并基于安卓平台开发了一款能够揭示用户使用手机行为并与第三方应用友好交互的移动应 用软件。这款应用不仅能够使用户清楚的了解他们的用户行为是怎样产生这些数据的，还能将从物理传感器 (硬件)以及虚拟传感器(软件)中采集的数据翻译成对用户有用易懂的信息。数据采集主要分为两个部分， 一部分是从访问移动设备的硬件及系统设定来采集数据，例如设备信息，屏幕感光,音量调节,Wi-Fi 连接情况， 电池使用情况等。另一部分数据与第三方应用息息相关，比如本应用能够突出在移动设备上安装的所有应用中 消耗流量最多的或占内存最大的应用，除此之外，该项目采用可视化图表清晰的反映出用户访问应用的时长及 频率。其他与手机用户日常生活及健康有关的数据亦可被采集，比如每日运动步数，用户定位，天气预报(基 于定位服务)等等。相比于现有情境感知的移动应用或网络服务而言，本项目能够采用低成本的方式帮助手机 用户更好的借助可视化的形式即时、直观地了解到个人智能移动设备的使用情况。
